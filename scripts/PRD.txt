# boAt Customer Support Chatbot PRD

# Overview
The boAt Customer Support Chatbot is an AI-powered virtual assistant designed to provide immediate, accurate responses to customer inquiries about return policies and service center locations. It aims to reduce support ticket volume, improve customer satisfaction, and provide 24/7 assistance for boAt product owners seeking support information without requiring human agent intervention.

# Core Features

## Vector Database Information Storage
- **What it does**: Scrapes, processes, and stores boAt's return policy documentation and service center location information in a vector database (ChromaDB)
- **Why it's important**: Enables semantic search capabilities and ensures responses are based on up-to-date, accurate company information
- **How it works**: Uses web scraping to extract information from provided links, processes the text, and stores embeddings in ChromaDB for efficient retrieval

## Multi-agent RAG System
- **What it does**: Implements a multi-agent system using AutoGen to coordinate different aspects of the customer support process
- **Why it's important**: Allows for specialized handling of different query types and more sophisticated response generation
- **How it works**: Utilizes multiple agents (query analyzer, retrieval agent, response generator) to process user inquiries, search the vector database, and formulate coherent answers

## Natural Language Query Processing
- **What it does**: Interprets natural language customer questions about return policies and service center locations
- **Why it's important**: Allows customers to ask questions in conversational language rather than using specific formats or keywords
- **How it works**: Uses LLM-based techniques to understand query intent, extract key information, and map to relevant knowledge areas

## Response Generation
- **What it does**: Creates clear, accurate, and helpful responses to customer inquiries based on boAt's official policies and information
- **Why it's important**: Ensures customers receive consistent, company-approved information that resolves their questions
- **How it works**: Uses RAG techniques to ground responses in factual information from the vector database, then formats responses conversationally

## Web-based Chat Interface
- **What it does**: Provides a simple, intuitive chat interface for customers to interact with the support bot
- **Why it's important**: Creates an accessible entry point for users seeking support information
- **How it works**: Uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, connected to the backend via WebSockets through FastAPI

# User Experience

## User Personas
1. **Product Owner Seeking Return Information**: Customer who recently purchased a boAt product and wants to understand return eligibility, process, or timeline
2. **Customer Needing Repair Services**: Customer with a damaged/malfunctioning product looking for the nearest service center location
3. **Potential Buyer Researching Policies**: Prospective customer evaluating boAt's customer service policies before making a purchase

## Key User Flows
1. **Return Policy Inquiry Flow**:
   - User navigates to chat interface
   - User types question about returns (e.g., "How do I return my earbuds?")
   - System identifies query type, retrieves relevant information
   - System provides specific return process details, eligibility requirements, or other requested information
   - System offers follow-up assistance if needed

2. **Service Center Location Flow**:
   - User navigates to chat interface
   - User asks about service centers (e.g., "Where can I repair my headphones in Mumbai?")
   - System identifies location in query
   - System retrieves and presents nearest service center(s) with address and contact information
   - System offers directions or additional assistance

## UI/UX Considerations
- Clean, minimalist interface matching boAt's brand aesthetic
- Clear indication of chatbot vs. human support capabilities
- Mobile-responsive design for customers on various devices
- Visual elements to enhance readability of service center information (potentially small maps)
- Easy way to switch to human support if needed
- Session persistence to maintain context during a support conversation
